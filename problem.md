## **Problem Statement: Modernizing Kenya’s Judicial System Through Data Intelligence**

Across Kenya’s courtrooms, a familiar scene plays out each day. Judges like Justice Achieng spend long hours sifting through old files, piecing together facts from documents stored in different systems or still held in physical form. Many of these cases were filed years earlier, yet they continue to consume valuable time because the information needed to resolve them is scattered or incomplete. This is not an isolated experience—it mirrors a judicial system straining under the weight of inefficiency. By 2023, the country had accumulated more than **500,000 pending cases**, with most disputes taking **three to five years** to conclude. Certain land and commercial matters stretch far longer, leaving citizens and businesses in limbo.

The impact of these delays reaches beyond the courts. Kenya ranked **164th globally** for contract enforcement in the *World Bank Doing Business 2020* report, which estimates that settling a commercial dispute requires **465 days** and **44 procedural steps**. A study by the University of Nairobi’s School of Law estimates that slow case resolution drains approximately **KES 2.3 billion every month** from the economy due to frozen investments, unresolved transactions, and lost opportunities. Public confidence is also eroding: according to Afrobarometer’s 2023 survey, trust in the judiciary dropped to **50%**, down from 57% in 2019. Many Kenyans associate the courts with lengthy processes, inconsistent rulings, and opaque operations.

Much of this crisis comes down to how judicial data is created, handled, and used. The challenges can be understood through four key stages:

### **1. Data Creation & Capture – Slow and Error-Prone Digitization**

A significant portion of court records—ranging from pleadings and evidence bundles to judgments—still exists on paper or in partially digitized formats. Court staff spend large amounts of time manually entering information, which leads to **5–10% error rates** and frequent misfiling. Handwritten notes, low-quality scans, and bilingual documentation (English and Kiswahili) introduce further complications. Judges often lose hours searching for complete case files, adding unnecessary delays to an already burdened system.

### **2. Data Validation & Trust – Difficulty Verifying Authentic Documents**

Forgery and tampered documents remain a major issue, contributing to nearly **one in five** case dismissals. Confirming the legitimacy of affidavits, certificates, and other filings typically requires reaching out to agencies such as KRA, NTSA, or county land registries—a process that can take days. Without tools for quick verification, courts face delays that open the door to manipulation and undermine confidence in outcomes.

### **3. Data Access & Utilization – Information Locked in Silos**

Judicial data is spread across multiple platforms that do not communicate with one another. This makes it difficult for judges and lawyers to locate case histories, past rulings, or relevant statutes. The result is inconsistent decisions, repeated hearings, and administrative bottlenecks that could be avoided with unified access to information.

### **4. Data Intelligence – Limited Use of Analytics and Forecasting**

Kenya’s judiciary currently lacks the analytical tools needed to forecast case timelines, assess resource needs, or identify emerging patterns. Without this visibility, the system remains reactive. Workloads vary dramatically across courts, timelines are unpredictable, and planning for future demand becomes guesswork.

# **Solution: Sheria — An AI-Driven Judicial Data Intelligence Platform**

Sheria is a modern governance platform designed to help Kenya’s judiciary tackle delays, improve accuracy, and strengthen trust in legal processes. It brings together digitization, verification, search, and predictive analytics into a single, unified system that fits naturally into everyday judicial workflows. The goal is simple: reduce the time spent looking for information and increase the time spent delivering justice.

Sheria addresses the four core challenges in the justice system—digitization bottlenecks, document authenticity, fragmented data, and lack of analytics—through the following integrated modules:

---

## **1. Digitize Documents — Automated OCR, Classification & Metadata Extraction**

Courts still rely heavily on handwritten notes, scanned pages, and paper files. Sheria turns these into clean, searchable digital records using:

* Advanced OCR trained on Kenyan handwriting, stamps, and legal templates
* Automatic classification of documents (affidavits, witness statements, rulings, evidence bundles, etc.)
* Entity extraction for names, dates, land parcel numbers, case numbers, and legal citations
* Multi-language support (English, Kiswahili, Sheng variants)

Judicial staff can digitize an entire file in minutes, reducing manual data entry and eliminating common errors like misfiling or missing pages. Once digitized, documents become instantly searchable across the entire platform.

---

## **2. Verify & Validate — Real-Time Document Authentication**

Sheria introduces a fast and reliable way to confirm the legitimacy of affidavits, certificates, land documents, and other records submitted in court. It uses:

* Cross-checks with trusted registries (KRA, NTSA, NLC, eCitizen, company registries)
* AI-driven fraud detection to spot anomalies, duplicates, tampered pages, or digital edits
* A blockchain-backed audit trail that preserves document integrity from submission to judgment

This eliminates days of back-and-forth with external agencies, reduces fraudulent filings, and helps protect the integrity of proceedings.

---

## **3. Ask — Conversational Search Across Laws, Cases & Court Records**

Instead of manually digging through multiple databases, judges and lawyers can ask Sheria questions in natural language, such as:

* “Show me all land disputes involving adverse possession between 2018 and 2023.”
* “What precedent exists for cancellation of forged title deeds?”
* “Summaries of related cases with similar facts to this one.”

The system retrieves documents, highlights cited sources, and provides context—helping judges make consistent, well-supported decisions.

---

## **4. Predict — Analytics & Forecasting for Judicial Efficiency**

Sheria’s predictive engine gives court leaders the ability to plan and act proactively. It provides:

* Forecasted timelines for each case based on complexity, history, and court workload
* Models estimating the risk of case stalling or being dismissed
* Resource optimization tools showing where courts are overloaded or underutilized
* Trend analysis for emerging legal disputes (e.g., land fraud hotspots, commercial defaults)

This supports evidence-based planning and reduces unpredictable delays.

---

## **Impact**

By integrating these capabilities, Sheria can help Kenya’s judiciary:

* Cut document processing times from hours to seconds
* Reduce verification delays from days to less than a minute
* Improve accuracy and consistency of judgments
* Accelerate clearance of the backlog
* Strengthen public trust through transparency and efficiency

Sheria is not a replacement for judicial experience—it is a tool that frees judges, registrars, and lawyers from repetitive work so they can focus on what matters most: fair, timely justice.
